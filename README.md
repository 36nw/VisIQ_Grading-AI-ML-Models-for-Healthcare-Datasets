# VisIQ - Avyuct Intellidetect Enhancement Project

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Project Overview

This repository, **VisIQ**, is dedicated to collaborative efforts aimed at enhancing the accuracy of Avyuct's product called Intellidetect. Intellidetect is designed for detecting anomalies in MRI images, CT scans, and X-rays. It is a cloud-based web application utilizing AI for diagnostics in healthcare, following a Software as a Service (SAAS) model.

## Avyuct Intellidetect

Avyuct Intellidetect is a cutting-edge cloud-based web application representing a transformative approach to healthcare diagnostics. It leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) within a SAAS platform for advanced image analysis. The application focuses on early disease detection through a three-step workflow: dataset creation, model building with customizable deep learning algorithms, and anomaly detection and segmentation.

## Accessing the Product

The product can be accessed through the user interface (UI) or via API. More detailed information and usage guidelines will be provided in the repository when available.

## Industry-Wide Neural Network Algorithms

The product utilizes industry-wide used open-source neural network algorithms for classification and segmentation tasks. The following algorithms are employed:

### For Classification:
- ResNet18
- VGG-16 
- AlexNet
- GoogLeNet
- MnasNet
- ResNet-50

### For Segmentation:
- U-Net

## Collaborative Enhancement

This repository is focused on collaborative efforts to enhance the accuracy of Avyuct Intellidetect.
